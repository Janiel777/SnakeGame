# SnakeGame

## about
This is a Snake project, a classic game where you have to move a snake through a grid and make it eat apples while avoiding hitting the walls or the snake's own body. This game is programmed in C++ using the openFrameworks library.

In this repository you will find the source code of the game, which is available to be used and modified by anyone. The goal of the project is to provide a modern version of Snake while also providing an opportunity for programmers to learn about C++ programming and game development.

The game is highly customizable, as parameters such as the speed of the snake, the number of apples needed to win, and the difficulty of the game can be adjusted. The source code is open for anyone to implement their own specifications or improvements to the game.

Have fun playing Snake and customizing the game your way!
